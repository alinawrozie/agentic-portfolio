# The bucket is fully private. It is NOT configured for "static website
# hosting" (that legacy S3 feature only supports HTTP, not HTTPS, and
# requires a public bucket). Instead, CloudFront's Origin Access Control
# (OAC) - the modern replacement for the older OAI - is granted a narrow
# bucket policy that lets CloudFront, and only CloudFront, read objects.
# Nobody can bypass CloudFront and hit the bucket directly.
